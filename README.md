# Fibonacci Sequences in C++

This repository contains examples of how to generate Fibonacci sequences using C++.

## What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It typically starts with 0 and 1.

Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

## Implementations

This repository includes the following implementations:

- **Iterative:**  A simple loop-based approach.
- **Recursive:**  A function that calls itself.
- **Dynamic Programming:** An optimized approach using memoization.

## Usage

Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

```bash
g++ -o fibonacci fibonacci.cpp
```

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./fibonacci
```

Feel free to explore the code and contribute your own implementations!
